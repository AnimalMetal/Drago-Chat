---

### "Incorrect password"

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure Caps Lock is OFF
2. Re-type your password carefully
3. If you forgot your password, contact the server administrator (they can reset it)

---

### Messages not saving

**Problem:** Your messages aren't being saved to files.

**Solutions:**
1. Open Settings (Ctrl+S) → General tab

4. Ask them to check their Friends list for pending requests

## Tips and Tricks

### Organizing Your Chats

- Chats appear in order of most recent activity (newest at top)
- Unread messages show a count: "John - 3 unread"
- Mute busy group chats to reduce notification noise
- Delete old chats you don't use (they'll reappear if someone messages you)

### Efficient Messaging

- Use Page Up/Down to quickly review messages without leaving the input box
- Use `/me` for expressive actions and roleplay
- Use Shift+Page Up to jump to the start of a conversation instantly
- Mute chats during work to focus, unmute when you want to chat

### Privacy and Safety

- Your messages are saved only on YOUR computer (not on the server)
- Only people you add as friends can message you
- You can leave any group chat at any time
- Block unwanted contacts by removing them from your friends list
- Your password is encrypted and never shown in plain text

### Group Chat Management

- Give groups clear, descriptive names ("Work Team", "Study Group", etc.)
- Only add people who want to be in the group
- Transfer admin to someone active if you're leaving or inactive
- Delete groups you no longer need to keep your list clean

### Keyboard Efficiency

- Learn the shortcuts: Ctrl+C (connect), Ctrl+D (disconnect), Ctrl+F (friends), Ctrl+S (settings)
- Use Application Key for quick actions (mute, view members, delete)
- Use Page Up/Down instead of arrow keys for faster message navigation
- Use Shift+Page Up/Down to jump to ends of conversations
